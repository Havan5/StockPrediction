21,stocks,AAPL,"I haven't read any good DD here in forever.

Here's something to think about:

1. The market tries to correctly value stocks by predicting their future earnings.

2. When trying to value stocks, the most common conclusion should be that the stock is trading within fair value range due to (1).

3. DD concluding that a stock is under or overvalued should be viewed with skepticism, especially for large cap stocks, because the poster is making a huge call by saying the market is mispricing the stock. Large cap stocks are well-covered and researched by the entire world.

I've been investing for awhile, and the confidence in which people claim stocks like AAPL or MSFT are under/overvalued tells me that they are extremely new to investing and shouldn't be giving out valuations.

I can hold a stock for a decade, read every report, and I still couldn't tell you that the stock is over or undervalued.  The reason is valuation is basically making predictions about what happens in the future. The stock price can be viewed as the aggregate prediction of all the buyers. 

How can someone, even knowing everything about the company, be more confident about what happens in the future, know exactly how things will play out and more than every other participant? 


Example, everyone has their opinion on AI. I don't care if people are optimistic or pessimistic on it, but I trust the person who can tell you the opportunities and risks, while acknowledging that they don't know exactly what will happen.

That's the problem. In fact, it's a huge problem not just with reddit but with every other platform. Everyone is trying to be a prophet because they know people just want someone to confidently give them the answers to the future.

That's why bogleheads and ETFs do well. They are trustworthy because they admit they can't predict the future. I'd rather listen to someone trustworthy with no info. than someone with lots of info. who is not trustworthy. 

The last point is that if people were actually confident on their own analysis, they would leverage to the max and make millions.

102,Investing,AMD,"Make passive income with covered calls.  You typically need level 2 options enabled in your brokerage account.  I do this in all of my cash accounts as well as my IRA accounts I've converted to IRA brokerage accounts and added the level 2 options ability.

Buy stocks I like in 100 share blocks.  I hold the stock and sell weekly calls and profit off the premium.  I pick stocks that are stuck in a range, but recently had high movement.  Premium is higher than normal due to the high Implied Volatility and generally decreases (""crushes"") as time progresses.  The call strike price I sell is usually .10 to .20 Delta.  


For example, I'd buy 100 shares of AMD.  I like the stock and would hold for the long term.   It's trading in a range, and I like to sell a weekly call just out of that range.  I see $190 as a good call strike.  I can sell one call at $1.15 per contract expiring March 28, and would look to sell one as a limit order at $1.15 ($115 actual contract value), although I'd maybe try a slightly higher price at market open.  IV is at 58%, which is high.  If the stock does not close higher than $190 at market close on March 28, the call I sold expires worthless and I keep the entire $115.  I do that every week as long as I keep liking AMD (sometimes I find a better stock or a better options deal and switch to another stock).  


Bought AMD at $180, so $18k initial investment.  If I get an average of $100 every week, that's $5200 per year. 29% gain.  If the AMD stock rises during the year, I'm selling calls at a higher and higher strike price.  If it goes lower, I'll sell at a lower strike.  It's AMD and they print money, so I'd expect the stock to rise after a year.


Now, what if AMD closes higher than $190 on March 28?  I can either buy the call back at a loss (I typically don't do this) or let the contract expire, and my 100 shares will be assigned at $190.  I keep the contract premium of $115, and get $19k for the sale of my shares.  Win - win.


Now what if AMD plummets?  Well, my call I sold that week definitely expires worthless and I keep the $115, but now I'm holding AMD stock at a loss.  No big deal, I'll look to sell another contract next week at a lower price, depending on how strong the move down was and the circumstances of the move.


If you don't know what the hell I'm talking about, you first need to learn about the options market, and learn the basics of price action and technical analysis.  By doing this, I've sped my path to retirement up by 10 years.


I run nearly 2 dozen accounts like this (I enjoy using multiple brokers), and treat the entire process like a business.  I track all my trades, my gains and the very tiny amount of losses, my stock entries and why I chose those stocks, my call option trades and why I chose that specific contract.

Buy stocks I like in 100 share blocks.  I hold the stock and sell weekly calls and profit off the premium.  I pick stocks that are stuck in a range, but recently had high movement.  Premium is higher than normal due to the high Implied Volatility and generally decreases (""crushes"") as time progresses.  The call strike price I sell is usually .10 to .20 Delta.  


For example, I'd buy 100 shares of AMD.  I like the stock and would hold for the long term.   It's trading in a range, and I like to sell a weekly call just out of that range.  I see $190 as a good call strike.  I can sell one call at $1.15 per contract expiring March 28, and would look to sell one as a limit order at $1.15 ($115 actual contract value), although I'd maybe try a slightly higher price at market open.  IV is at 58%, which is high.  If the stock does not close higher than $190 at market close on March 28, the call I sold expires worthless and I keep the entire $115.  I do that every week as long as I keep liking AMD (sometimes I find a better stock or a better options deal and switch to another stock).  


Bought AMD at $180, so $18k initial investment.  If I get an average of $100 every week, that's $5200 per year. 29% gain.  If the AMD stock rises during the year, I'm selling calls at a higher and higher strike price.  If it goes lower, I'll sell at a lower strike.  It's AMD and they print money, so I'd expect the stock to rise after a year.


Now, what if AMD closes higher than $190 on March 28?  I can either buy the call back at a loss (I typically don't do this) or let the contract expire, and my 100 shares will be assigned at $190.  I keep the contract premium of $115, and get $19k for the sale of my shares.  Win - win.


Now what if AMD plummets?  Well, my call I sold that week definitely expires worthless and I keep the $115, but now I'm holding AMD stock at a loss.  No big deal, I'll look to sell another contract next week at a lower price, depending on how strong the move down was and the circumstances of the move.

Buy stocks I like in 100 share blocks.  I hold the stock and sell weekly calls and profit off the premium.  I pick stocks that are stuck in a range, but recently had high movement.  Premium is higher than normal due to the high Implied Volatility and generally decreases (""crushes"") as time progresses.  The call strike price I sell is usually .10 to .20 Delta.  


For example, I'd buy 100 shares of AMD.  I like the stock and would hold for the long term.   It's trading in a range, and I like to sell a weekly call just out of that range.  I see $190 as a good call strike.

I do that every week as long as I keep liking AMD (sometimes I find a better stock or a better options deal and switch to another stock).  


Bought AMD at $180, so $18k initial investment.  If I get an average of $100 every week, that's $5200 per year. 29% gain.  If the AMD stock rises during the year, I'm selling calls at a higher and higher strike price.  If it goes lower, I'll sell at a lower strike.  It's AMD and they print money, so I'd expect the stock to rise after a year.


Now, what if AMD closes higher than $190 on March 28?  I can either buy the call back at a loss (I typically don't do this) or let the contract expire, and my 100 shares will be assigned at $190.  I keep the contract premium of $115, and get $19k for the sale of my shares.  Win - win.


Now what if AMD plummets?  Well, my call I sold that week definitely expires worthless and I keep the $115, but now I'm holding AMD stock at a loss.  No big deal, I'll look to sell another contract next week at a lower price, depending on how strong the move down was and the circumstances of the move.

146,Investing,AMD,"Make passive income with covered calls.  You typically need level 2 options enabled in your brokerage account.  I do this in all of my cash accounts as well as my IRA accounts I've converted to IRA brokerage accounts and added the level 2 options ability.

Buy stocks I like in 100 share blocks.  I hold the stock and sell weekly calls and profit off the premium.  I pick stocks that are stuck in a range, but recently had high movement.  Premium is higher than normal due to the high Implied Volatility and generally decreases (""crushes"") as time progresses.  The call strike price I sell is usually .10 to .20 Delta.  


For example, I'd buy 100 shares of AMD.  I like the stock and would hold for the long term.   It's trading in a range, and I like to sell a weekly call just out of that range.  I see $190 as a good call strike.  I can sell one call at $1.15 per contract expiring March 28, and would look to sell one as a limit order at $1.15 ($115 actual contract value), although I'd maybe try a slightly higher price at market open.  IV is at 58%, which is high.  If the stock does not close higher than $190 at market close on March 28, the call I sold expires worthless and I keep the entire $115.  I do that every week as long as I keep liking AMD (sometimes I find a better stock or a better options deal and switch to another stock).  


Bought AMD at $180, so $18k initial investment.  If I get an average of $100 every week, that's $5200 per year. 29% gain.  If the AMD stock rises during the year, I'm selling calls at a higher and higher strike price.  If it goes lower, I'll sell at a lower strike.  It's AMD and they print money, so I'd expect the stock to rise after a year.


Now, what if AMD closes higher than $190 on March 28?  I can either buy the call back at a loss (I typically don't do this) or let the contract expire, and my 100 shares will be assigned at $190.  I keep the contract premium of $115, and get $19k for the sale of my shares.  Win - win.


Now what if AMD plummets?  Well, my call I sold that week definitely expires worthless and I keep the $115, but now I'm holding AMD stock at a loss.  No big deal, I'll look to sell another contract next week at a lower price, depending on how strong the move down was and the circumstances of the move.

You obviously saved money, so keep doing that.  10% of your income if you can afford it into VTI/VOO/BRK.   34/33/33 


Or split 25% each and add in an even split of MGK/VGT (12.5% each) if you want to lean a little more into tech for the future.




this should be this whole portfolio. That's it. Call this your ""Boomerfolio""




Then, if you STILL have money to play with and want to invest, you should set up A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. This is critical. This is for buying individual stocks to gamble on.  Never ever take away from your 10% that goes into your boomerfolio to put in your gambling stock picking account. Ever.

162,Investing,AMD,"I moved to PR in part for an adventure and another part because all capital gains are taxed at 0%.  The house I rented the first 3 years was a massive 5 bedroom, 5 bath, 3 car garage, 5,000 square foot “castle” on the hill side overlooking the ocean and Vieques.  On a clear day you could even see the US and Virgin Islands off on the horizon as you were washing dishes in the kitchen.  I say “castle” because it literally had a Rapunzel tower that gave access to each of the 5 different floors.  

The rent at this place was $5,000 a month and I split it with my business partner and our business took the remaining 3rd since we turned on floor into our office.  We were living like kings for pretty cheap, and when COVID hit we were locked up in this massive property with a pool, hot tub, and amazing views. So life wasn’t so bad all things considered.  

The owner of the house, a local Puerto Rican, told us she would never ever sell it because her dad built it himself and because he was a CEO in a big hurricane window company, all of the 50 windows were purchased below cost.  She told us you couldn’t build the house today for less than $1.2m and that was the price she would sell it if she ever considered parting with the family property.  The housing market in PR isn’t like stateside and the whole market has been underwater since the 2008 crisis. This home still had yet to hit the $1.2m water mark her dad built it for back in 2005ish. Too bad our rental attorney didn’t write a first right of refusal to buy in our contract because what transpired turned out to be my biggest financial mistake ever (I’m 42 so I haven’t had that many).  

So covid hits and everyone from the states starts moving down to PR for the weather and tax savings and to start a new adventure amid the great Covid reset. Rental rates that were $5k a month go to $10k a month and tiny places that were only $2000 a month suddenly because as much as the entire rent in our 5 story mansion.  The owner had casually offered her house to me or my business partner for $1.2m but nothing was in writing and I thought she would never sell it anyways.  So I was shocked in late 2020 when she said she was getting it appraised.  Not shockingly, the appraisal came back at $1.6m and my realtor friend was telling me it was still a great price.  

Now at the time I wasn’t yet married and since I lived in this house for a few years, I knew all the crazy issues it had.  I won’t get into them here but since the house was a 5 story home built with solid concrete on a hill side, repairing these plumbing and electrical issues wasn’t something I wanted to tackle.  Plus, I couldn’t swallow buying a house for $1.6m when I had just been offered it for $1.2m a few months earlier.  It felt like the bubble was inflating and the end of Covid seemed near and honestly having a ton of capital invested in the Wild West that is Puerto Rico didn’t sit well with me.  

So for the next 8 months we see all these potential buyers visiting to look at the house.  It finally sells for $1.5m I believe and the new owner is super cool and lets us finish out the year. I think it sold in Sept and we eventually moved out during Thanksgiving and got $5k back for the month of Dec so he could move in for Christmas.  

I wind up becoming good friends with the buyer and he host events at his house all the time.  He winds up adding a solar field to the hillside, converts some of the non AC’d storage rooms into liveable spaces, adds a beer brewing room, etc etc and all in all puts about $400k in renovations.  He is now in for about $1.9m.

Just for shits and giggles, he puts the house up for sale in a “make me move” kind of situation for $3.2m.  The house doesn’t sell for a good year or more and I’m thinking his house is probably worth close to that now with all the other big homes inflating too but I try not to think about it.  

This Jan, 2 years after I could have bought the house for $1.2m, I hear from him that he has a contract on the house and he will probably be moving.  The sale price….$3.7m!!!  I couldn’t believe it!

So in 2 years, my friend made $1.8m on a home he bought, lived in, and sold all within 2 years.  If I had bought it for $1.2 and did the same renovations, I could have made $2.1m.  And it all would have been 100% tax free, money in the bank.

194,Investing,AMD,"This is just my rationale; I'm 100% open to criticism on it, I'm by no means infallible.

For me, Jensen said it best, generative AI can take any business with a digital aspect and make its production 3-6x faster and thus more efficient. The Bears seem up in arms that NVDA is highly speculated (taking a position with substantial risk of loss or profit), but there's no competitor poised to really step in and replace Nvidia or even compete with them, really. Competition is inevitable, but replacement? No. 

While Nvidia doesn't make their own chips, who does? With 80% market share (and growing based on earnings) and companies wanting to leap ahead of competitors in a global market, no one is waiting to pull the trigger on AI, they already want it they just have difficulty getting their hands on it and supply is getting better. What other company can basically proclaim in their earnings call that every product they make this year will sell out and that their limitation will be supply? Not AMD, nor Intel.

Thinking about Microsoft (3T market cap) and Apple (2.6T market cap), Nvidia (2.2T market cap) is in a position to meet or overtake both of these because their hoppers can help—literally—any company looking to use generative AI and they are mostly software-driven and tuned up by subscription which could be almost every company using it paying for this update-service. Nvidia going to $1,050/share would be about 2.6T market cap and $1200/share would be 3T market cap? I can see Nvidia doing a 10:1 share split and becoming part of a trifecta with Apple and Microsoft, a sort of global tech tripod, so to speak. They have carved out their market niche, they just need to keep it. That will be sured up once the U.S. starts making their own chips, relying less on TSM. I do worry about Taiwan and China getting into it a bit, but that would also screw China over to disrupt their own supply, and inspire of what many people may think. China isn't really the ""start a war"" type. I think China is more interested in maintaining its market footing and competitiveness. War screws that up. So for now I think that part looks okay.

I do worry I'm overly optimistic. That's my issue. Nvidia is over its 50-day moving average and 21-day fast moving average, but I don't think that's necessarily deserving of a drop, bears be damned.  My suspicion is that it will meet resistance around.  $1050 and $1200 to overtake Apple and Microsoft, respectively. As for when it will get there... I think the ""market"" has chosen their footing and are waiting for receipts. Vanguard and Blackrock have 8.2% and 7.2% stakes in Nvidia respectively.

258,StockMarket,CEO,"Here's a breakdown of the potential drivers and considerations

**Expectations of Profitability and Revenue Growth:**

* Wall Street analysts anticipate GameStop to report a profitable Q4, with an expected EPS of $0.30, signifying an 84% increase compared to the previous year's period. Additionally, the video game industry experienced growth in 2023, driven by a strong holiday season, which could positively impact GameStop's revenue figures, potentially surpassing the $2 billion mark

**Investment Policy Shift:**

* GameStop's recent shift in investment policy, granting CEO Ryan Cohen authority to allocate cash reserves toward equity investments, has garnered investor interest. Any updates on this matter during the earnings release could influence GameStop's share performance

**Direct Registration System (DRS) Shareholding:**

* Retail investors have actively registered their shares with transfer agent Computershare, effectively locking away a significant portion of GME shares from brokers. If these figures are reported to be maintained or increased, it could have a bullish effect on the stock price

**Short Squeeze, Positive Sentiment, and Strong Fundamentals:**

* GameStop's high short interest, positive sentiment among retail investors, and strong financial results, including revenue growth and net income, have collectively contributed to the stock's rally ahead of earnings.

I saw the title here and went to check if Boeing has a dividend. It doesn't.

The accepted wisdom among finance morons (because truly, that's what they are) is that the ""tax efficiency"" (that's what they call it, don't blame me) of dividends is outclassed by buying back the shares, which has two interesting effects:

1 - It increases earnings per share, but even more important 

2 - It keeps those options the CEO and his henchmen are paid in valuable.

This is robbery pure and simple.

339,Investing,CEO,"I moved to PR in part for an adventure and another part because all capital gains are taxed at 0%.  The house I rented the first 3 years was a massive 5 bedroom, 5 bath, 3 car garage, 5,000 square foot “castle” on the hill side overlooking the ocean and Vieques.  On a clear day you could even see the US and Virgin Islands off on the horizon as you were washing dishes in the kitchen.  I say “castle” because it literally had a Rapunzel tower that gave access to each of the 5 different floors.  

The rent at this place was $5,000 a month and I split it with my business partner and our business took the remaining 3rd since we turned on floor into our office.  We were living like kings for pretty cheap, and when COVID hit we were locked up in this massive property with a pool, hot tub, and amazing views. So life wasn’t so bad all things considered.  

The owner of the house, a local Puerto Rican, told us she would never ever sell it because her dad built it himself and because he was a CEO in a big hurricane window company, all of the 50 windows were purchased below cost.  She told us you couldn’t build the house today for less than $1.2m and that was the price she would sell it if she ever considered parting with the family property.  The housing market in PR isn’t like stateside and the whole market has been underwater since the 2008 crisis. This home still had yet to hit the $1.2m water mark her dad built it for back in 2005ish. Too bad our rental attorney didn’t write a first right of refusal to buy in our contract because what transpired turned out to be my biggest financial mistake ever (I’m 42 so I haven’t had that many).  

So covid hits and everyone from the states starts moving down to PR for the weather and tax savings and to start a new adventure amid the great Covid reset. Rental rates that were $5k a month go to $10k a month and tiny places that were only $2000 a month suddenly because as much as the entire rent in our 5 story mansion.  The owner had casually offered her house to me or my business partner for $1.2m but nothing was in writing and I thought she would never sell it anyways.  So I was shocked in late 2020 when she said she was getting it appraised.  Not shockingly, the appraisal came back at $1.6m and my realtor friend was telling me it was still a great price.  

Now at the time I wasn’t yet married and since I lived in this house for a few years, I knew all the crazy issues it had.  I won’t get into them here but since the house was a 5 story home built with solid concrete on a hill side, repairing these plumbing and electrical issues wasn’t something I wanted to tackle.  Plus, I couldn’t swallow buying a house for $1.6m when I had just been offered it for $1.2m a few months earlier.  It felt like the bubble was inflating and the end of Covid seemed near and honestly having a ton of capital invested in the Wild West that is Puerto Rico didn’t sit well with me.  

So for the next 8 months we see all these potential buyers visiting to look at the house.  It finally sells for $1.5m I believe and the new owner is super cool and lets us finish out the year. I think it sold in Sept and we eventually moved out during Thanksgiving and got $5k back for the month of Dec so he could move in for Christmas.  

I wind up becoming good friends with the buyer and he host events at his house all the time.  He winds up adding a solar field to the hillside, converts some of the non AC’d storage rooms into liveable spaces, adds a beer brewing room, etc etc and all in all puts about $400k in renovations.  He is now in for about $1.9m.

Just for shits and giggles, he puts the house up for sale in a “make me move” kind of situation for $3.2m.  The house doesn’t sell for a good year or more and I’m thinking his house is probably worth close to that now with all the other big homes inflating too but I try not to think about it.  

This Jan, 2 years after I could have bought the house for $1.2m, I hear from him that he has a contract on the house and he will probably be moving.  The sale price….$3.7m!!!  I couldn’t believe it!

So in 2 years, my friend made $1.8m on a home he bought, lived in, and sold all within 2 years.  If I had bought it for $1.2 and did the same renovations, I could have made $2.1m.  And it all would have been 100% tax free, money in the bank.  

I still feel like my reasons for not buying it to begin with are sound and everything is obvious with hindsight being 20/20 but it still stings quite a bit.  I could be completely retired at 42 and just focus 100% on my family and having a great lifestyle, but the hustle remains.

Luckily I bought a shit ton of Nvidia in 2017 when it was $27 a share! Did the same with AMD for $14 a share.  Still own both positions.

417,stocks,MSFT,"I haven't read any good DD here in forever.

Here's something to think about:

1. The market tries to correctly value stocks by predicting their future earnings.

2. When trying to value stocks, the most common conclusion should be that the stock is trading within fair value range due to (1).

3. DD concluding that a stock is under or overvalued should be viewed with skepticism, especially for large cap stocks, because the poster is making a huge call by saying the market is mispricing the stock. Large cap stocks are well-covered and researched by the entire world.

I've been investing for awhile, and the confidence in which people claim stocks like AAPL or MSFT are under/overvalued tells me that they are extremely new to investing and shouldn't be giving out valuations.

I can hold a stock for a decade, read every report, and I still couldn't tell you that the stock is over or undervalued.  The reason is valuation is basically making predictions about what happens in the future. The stock price can be viewed as the aggregate prediction of all the buyers. 

How can someone, even knowing everything about the company, be more confident about what happens in the future, know exactly how things will play out and more than every other participant? 


Example, everyone has their opinion on AI. I don't care if people are optimistic or pessimistic on it, but I trust the person who can tell you the opportunities and risks, while acknowledging that they don't know exactly what will happen.

That's the problem. In fact, it's a huge problem not just with reddit but with every other platform. Everyone is trying to be a prophet because they know people just want someone to confidently give them the answers to the future.

That's why bogleheads and ETFs do well. They are trustworthy because they admit they can't predict the future. I'd rather listen to someone trustworthy with no info. than someone with lots of info. who is not trustworthy. 

The last point is that if people were actually confident on their own analysis, they would leverage to the max and make millions. The fact that people are looking for confirmation on reddit tells me they don't have confidence.",wearahat03,03-17-24,havent read any good dd here in forever. heres something to think about tries to correctly value predicting their future earnings. when trying to value most common conclusion should be that stock within fair value range due to dd concluding that stock under overvalued should be viewed with skepticism especially large cap poster making huge call saying mispricing stock. large cap wellcovered researched entire world. ive been investing awhile confidence in which people claim like aapl msft underovervalued tells me that extremely new to investing shouldnt be giving out valuations. can hold stock decade read every report still couldnt tell that stock over undervalued. reason valuation basically making predictions about what happens in future. stock can be viewed as aggregate prediction of all buyers. how can someone even knowing everything about be more confident about what happens in future know exactly how things will play out more than every other participant? example everyone their opinion ai. dont care if people optimistic pessimistic trust person who can tell opportunities risks while acknowledging that dont know exactly what will happen. thats problem. in fact its huge problem not just with reddit with every other platform. everyone trying to be prophet know people just want someone to confidently give them answers to future. thats why bogleheads etfs do well. trustworthy admit cant predict future. id rather listen to someone trustworthy with no info. than someone with lots of info. who not trustworthy. last point that if people actually confident their own analysis would leverage to max make millions. fact that people looking confirmation reddit tells me dont confidence.,0.071,0.623,0.306,0.998,0.32424454391002655,0.13677683845162392,0.4471692778170109

420,Investing,MSFT,"The market is very volatile at the moment, but when the S&P stabilizes that may be a good bet. PHLX (SOX) also does quite well, if you're interested in computer chips. Right now NVDA and MSFT among others are propping up the performance of both so would avoid putting your eggs all in these baskets since they could both fall at the same time.

It may help for you to track the price trends of the indices and see what ETFs exist in whatever seems to be trending toward increasing value at a given time. Be wary of making sure that if / when buy and sell takes place you have them be careful not to spend money that hasn't settled yet (just a precaution to protect against the 90day restriction penalty) and also do not let them touch options. That stuff melts your money faster than you can blink.

Note also, some ETFs are leveraged. They may be inverse to the index of choice or some multiple of its performance and loss (usually 2-3x). I personally avoid them when their index is too volatile due to the risk exposure.

When they reach 1M (in like 10-12 years if they do well but more likely much longer), start moving money into dividend paying stocks that also perform well. At 3M (in inflation adjusted dollars) that can generate enough in dividends and gains combined to mostly live off of.

Compare: 12% return ---some-math--> 21 years to reach 10x value, or <31yrs to reach $3M  
vs:            15% return --->                       17 years ----->                         <25yrs

Many people who trade find it hard to beat the market.  
The S&P, being the proxy for that, makes average \~**9.74%** over the past 20 or so years but this year has done multiples of that.

A 9% return on 100k is $9k which isn't enough to live on, but at 400k, or 36k gain at 9%, that's difficult but possible to survive on. If you cannot get returns in enough time or invest some additional amounts with time to speed this along, it may be more advisable to use an alternative. I am not sure you have many other options that can get you returns that will be livable on in less time. Moreover, the point of investing is to grow your money, not spend it before it can grow. If you only make 9% and spend 9%, your net is 0%. That'd be no different than living paycheck to paycheck except you also won't know if the next one comes or not. Better to reach a safer larger value first.

Keep in mind your goals should be:

* do better than SPY in terms of % gain
* do better than inflation / 10-year treasury bond rate
* do better than the two combined if you can
* COMPANIES WITH:
   * low volatility (low positive beta / price oscillation)
   * stable history of steady gaining value
   * little to no debt (see fundamentals / SEC reports)
   * increasing revenue
   * cash flow positive

The wiki has some helpful info also, and you and them would benefit reading some investopedia articles to better understand some stuff. If stocks are not what you want to do, others in this thread have much better advice than I can offer. The biggest difference with a rentable real estate property, besides overhead, is that you have a statically increasing source of income potentially (if you can rent it) - compared to stocks, the return potential is much less but potentially much more reliable. Be careful who you partner with to buy properties, if anyone. A bad partnership can ruin the rent and sale value of an otherwise valuable property. Moreover, buying a property may leave you with debts and lack of cash until the property is paid off (may take a long time). Compare this with stocks where you can get returns of 8-12% if you're careful and investing when the market is more stable plus can liquidate the shares within a manner of days if needed.

One last thing, I find it really informative when two indices move in opposite directions. Those are really good opportunities to look up what the top movers common and different between the two are.

Commonsense. Particularly your Spidey-sense is telling you that shit just can't be this easy.

You're selling a naked put. You're assuming crazy risk for $36k, which you keep at settlement if NVDA is higher than $540. However, that's ***at settlement***. 

Should NVDA drop $100 today from $870 to $770 then your option is going to gain a ton of value.

Stop chasing the quick turn around, it’s gambling not investing, there is a big difference and if you’re gambling your life savings in meme stocks and crypto to make a gazillion overnight it ain’t gonna happen and you’re gonna go broke trying, exhibit A. My advice, retail traders always lose, no good trader that works on Wall Street is using technical analysis, support and resistance, or any of that bullshit, it’s a completely different ball game for them and they’re able to manipulate the market with their capital to win; have you ever heard of a liquidity sweep? Honestly there are two types of traders, institutional traders and losers, stop buying into all the day trader bullshit, meme coin shit you see on YouTube and instead invest 10-15% of each paycheck into quality blue chip and growth stocks along with some ETFs and you will be father ahead than most people. You are young and time is on your side, use the power of compounding to your advantage and build a portfolio, it takes time to compound sure, but the earlier you start the more you will maximize the compounding effect due to the time value of money. By having a long term hold strategy you don’t stress out day to day wondering if you’re gonna blow your account AND by not selling you avoid paying taxes on the capital gains which is HUGE. Then if you need to access some capital, borrow against your assets, debt is tax free. Point being, build up your account for the long run, time is on your side, once you have a big enough account in 10-20 years, then maybe consider trading but only use money that you’re okay losing to trade and most importantly ONLY TRADE OPPORTUNITY, DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT buy into the technical analysis BS everyone is trying to sell you on, you’re going to force trades and you’re going to get burnt. A good example of this would be NVDA currently, it’s exploding, that is the type of opportunity that makes sense to swing trade or to hold long term, either way you’ll probably make money. Rich people think in decades and more millionaires make it by compounding their wealth over many decades than people do betting on a meme stock. Getting rich takes time for 99% of people and the other 1% is calculated luck. Clear your head, start fresh, and INVEST, not trade, not gamble, invest.

577,Investing,NVDA,"The market is very volatile at the moment, but when the S&P stabilizes that may be a good bet. PHLX (SOX) also does quite well, if you're interested in computer chips. Right now NVDA and MSFT among others are propping up the performance of both so would avoid putting your eggs all in these baskets since they could both fall at the same time.

It may help for you to track the price trends of the indices and see what ETFs exist in whatever seems to be trending toward increasing value at a given time. Be wary of making sure that if / when buy and sell takes place you have them be careful not to spend money that hasn't settled yet (just a precaution to protect against the 90day restriction penalty) and also do not let them touch options. That stuff melts your money faster than you can blink.

Note also, some ETFs are leveraged. They may be inverse to the index of choice or some multiple of its performance and loss (usually 2-3x). I personally avoid them when their index is too volatile due to the risk exposure.

When they reach 1M (in like 10-12 years if they do well but more likely much longer), start moving money into dividend paying stocks that also perform well. At 3M (in inflation adjusted dollars) that can generate enough in dividends and gains combined to mostly live off of.

Compare: 12% return ---some-math--> 21 years to reach 10x value, or <31yrs to reach $3M  
vs:            15% return --->                       17 years ----->                         <25yrs

Many people who trade find it hard to beat the market.  
The S&P, being the proxy for that, makes average \~**9.74%** over the past 20 or so years but this year has done multiples of that.

A 9% return on 100k is $9k which isn't enough to live on, but at 400k, or 36k gain at 9%, that's difficult but possible to survive on. If you cannot get returns in enough time or invest some additional amounts with time to speed this along, it may be more advisable to use an alternative. I am not sure you have many other options that can get you returns that will be livable on in less time. Moreover, the point of investing is to grow your money, not spend it before it can grow. If you only make 9% and spend 9%, your net is 0%. That'd be no different than living paycheck to paycheck except you also won't know if the next one comes or not. Better to reach a safer larger value first.

Keep in mind your goals should be:

* do better than SPY in terms of % gain
* do better than inflation / 10-year treasury bond rate
* do better than the two combined if you can
* COMPANIES WITH:
   * low volatility (low positive beta / price oscillation)
   * stable history of steady gaining value
   * little to no debt (see fundamentals / SEC reports)
   * increasing revenue
   * cash flow positive

The wiki has some helpful info also, and you and them would benefit reading some investopedia articles to better understand some stuff. If stocks are not what you want to do, others in this thread have much better advice than I can offer. The biggest difference with a rentable real estate property, besides overhead, is that you have a statically increasing source of income potentially (if you can rent it) - compared to stocks, the return potential is much less but potentially much more reliable. Be careful who you partner with to buy properties, if anyone. A bad partnership can ruin the rent and sale value of an otherwise valuable property. Moreover, buying a property may leave you with debts and lack of cash until the property is paid off (may take a long time). Compare this with stocks where you can get returns of 8-12% if you're careful and investing when the market is more stable plus can liquidate the shares within a manner of days if needed.

One last thing, I find it really informative when two indices move in opposite directions. Those are really good opportunities to look up what the top movers common and different between the two are.

597,Investing,NVDA,"The only time to sell a company that you bought as an investment is when you find another company that you believe is a better value at the current price than the one you are holding. If you find a company that you really believe in and you think it has more growth potential at the price it is trading at, a smart investor would sell the ""overvalued"" stock and buy the undervalued one. A company is only ""overvalued"" relative to other companies, it is subjective and you have to learn how to value a company based on its fundamentals and your own opinions.

There are a lot of factors that determine when you should do this. For example, if you're not very active in the market, you should only buy companies that you are absolutely confident in holding for the long term. If you are more active, you can rebalance your portfolio more often, but there is a very fine line between trading and investing. If you're not a trader, and you don't aspire to be, you should not be moving your positions around too often.

I personally think NVDA is a great company and that it has more growth to come, but I strongly believe that you can't go wrong taking profits at these prices as long as you are moving the money into something you think is a better value. When I sell a company, I don't like to sell my entire position as it lets me keep an eye on the price and help me know when I should add to it (or sell more). I only ever buy companies in my investment account that I'm okay with holding for a long time, so this approach works well for me.

632,Investing,NVDA,"This is just my rationale; I'm 100% open to criticism on it, I'm by no means infallible.

For me, Jensen said it best, generative AI can take any business with a digital aspect and make its production 3-6x faster and thus more efficient. The Bears seem up in arms that NVDA is highly speculated (taking a position with substantial risk of loss or profit), but there's no competitor poised to really step in and replace Nvidia or even compete with them, really. Competition is inevitable, but replacement? No. 

While Nvidia doesn't make their own chips, who does? With 80% market share (and growing based on earnings) and companies wanting to leap ahead of competitors in a global market, no one is waiting to pull the trigger on AI, they already want it they just have difficulty getting their hands on it and supply is getting better. What other company can basically proclaim in their earnings call that every product they make this year will sell out and that their limitation will be supply? Not AMD, nor Intel.

Thinking about Microsoft (3T market cap) and Apple (2.6T market cap), Nvidia (2.2T market cap) is in a position to meet or overtake both of these because their hoppers can help—literally—any company looking to use generative AI and they are mostly software-driven and tuned up by subscription which could be almost every company using it paying for this update-service. Nvidia going to $1,050/share would be about 2.6T market cap and $1200/share would be 3T market cap? I can see Nvidia doing a 10:1 share split and becoming part of a trifecta with Apple and Microsoft, a sort of global tech tripod, so to speak. They have carved out their market niche, they just need to keep it. That will be sured up once the U.S. starts making their own chips, relying less on TSM. I do worry about Taiwan and China getting into it a bit, but that would also screw China over to disrupt their own supply, and inspire of what many people may think. China isn't really the ""start a war"" type. I think China is more interested in maintaining its market footing and competitiveness. War screws that up. So for now I think that part looks okay.

I do worry I'm overly optimistic. That's my issue. Nvidia is over its 50-day moving average and 21-day fast moving average, but I don't think that's necessarily deserving of a drop, bears be damned.  My suspicion is that it will meet resistance around.  $1050 and $1200 to overtake Apple and Microsoft, respectively. As for when it will get there... I think the ""market"" has chosen their footing and are waiting for receipts. Vanguard and Blackrock have 8.2% and 7.2% stakes in Nvidia respectively. I feel like they are in it for a 3-5 year investment.

Ugh. Typing it all out makes me feel like I should dawn an aluminum foil hat. I have a pretty large position in Nvidia, but I'm not sentimental about it. I just look around and Nvidia looks like the best thing to invest in that I understand.",SmolBabyLizard,03-11-24,this just my rationale im open to criticism im no means infallible. me jensen said best generative ai can take any business with digital aspect make its production x faster thus more efficient. bears seem up in arms that nvda highly speculated taking position with substantial risk of loss profit theres no competitor poised to really step in replace nvidia even compete with them really. competition inevitable replacement? no. while nvidia doesnt make their own chips who does? with growing based earnings wanting to leap ahead of competitors in global no one waiting to pull trigger ai already want just difficulty getting their hands supply getting better. what other can basically proclaim in their earnings call that every product make this year will sell out that their limitation will be supply? not amd nor intel. thinking about microsoft t cap apple t cap nvidia t cap in position to meet overtake both of these their hoppers can help literally any looking to use generative ai mostly softwaredriven tuned up subscription which could be almost every using paying this updateservice. nvidia going to would be about t cap would be t cap? can see nvidia doing split becoming part of trifecta with apple microsoft sort of global tech tripod so to speak. carved out their niche just need to keep it. that will be sured up once u. s. starts making their own chips relying less tsm. do worry about taiwan china getting into bit that would also screw china over to disrupt their own supply inspire of what many people may think. china isnt really start war type. think china more interested in maintaining its footing competitiveness. war screws that up. so now think that part looks okay. do worry im overly optimistic. thats my issue. nvidia over its day moving average day fast moving average dont think thats necessarily deserving of drop bears be damned. my suspicion that will meet resistance around. to overtake apple microsoft respectively. as when will get there... think chosen their footing waiting receipts. vanguard blackrock stakes in nvidia respectively. feel like in year investment. ugh. typing all out makes me feel like should dawn aluminum foil hat. pretty large position in nvidia im not sentimental about it. just look around nvidia looks like best thing to invest in that understand.,0.124,0.638,0.238,0.9965,0.33571484982967376,0.2195718467235565,0.2824821054935455

**The Mother of All Speculative Bubbles: Tulip mania**
  

  
Tulip mania occurred during the Dutch Golden Age, when the Dutch Republic became a maritime and economic powerhouse, and the Netherlands had the largest economy in the world. The Dutch East India Company held a monopoly on the spice trade, and established the world’s first stock exchange, boosting Dutch economic growth. When Tulip mania occurred, contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels. The major acceleration began in 1634 and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637.
  

  
Tulip mania is widely considered to be the first recorded speculative bubble or asset bubble in history. During this time, tulip bulbs became a symbol of wealth and status, and their prices soared to incredible heights. At the peak of tulip mania, single tulip bulbs were selling for more than ten times the annual income of a skilled artisan. During the height of tulip mania, a skilled crafts worker typically earned about 300 guilders per year (equivalent to around 1,800 euros today). Imagine paying 18,000 euros for a single flower bulb! The rarest tulip bulbs fetched even higher astronomical sums.
  

  
The term “tulip mania” is now often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble when asset prices deviate dramatically higher from intrinsic values. It serves as a cautionary tale about irrational exuberance in financial markets. Tulip mania gained popular attention in 1841 with the publication of the book **“Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds”** by Scottish journalist Charles Mackay. Mackay claimed that many investors were ruined by the fall in tulip prices. Tulip mania was a fascinating episode in economic history, where the speculative allure of tulips led to both incredible wealth, and eventual disillusionment and financial ruin.

If NVDA market cap is increasing due to stock price increasing then its share of VTI is also increasing due to the same stock price increasing.

Outside of user inflows/outflows an index fund like VOO/VTI only has to buy or sell when there is a change in the index NOT due to changing prices:
* a company issues new shares and thus raises its market cap even with zero change in price
* a company buys for cash (not stock) another member of the index
* a company spins off a company and due to its size the spin off is not a part of the index
* a merger of two companies in the index which is not 100% stock paid.
* a merger of a company which is part of the index to another not part of the index
* a company leaves the index
* a company joins the index

867,Investing,NVDA,"I have made 2 mistakes that I think every new investor should learn from. I will list them:

1. Being a very new investor and googling stuff like ""what is a good stock to buy now"" sent me to some very horrible companies. I didn't lose too much money, I was always a chicken shit and did not have the balls to put too much money into something speculative (thankfully). Just start with index funds and once you have a healthy portfolio, set aside play funds.

2. Selling some stuff too early. Like I said before, I was a chicken shit, so never really put too much money into single stocks. So, even if my single picks went to zero, it would sting, but I would be able to recover. My finest move in retrospect was selling 30 NVDA shares pre split @ about $99 each and held on to 6 shares. Did I make a profit selling the 30? Yes I did, but again, in retrospect, I should've held since I had not put in too much to begin with. I always believed in the company (never expected it to blow up like this though) and I should've held. But as a newbie, you're still learning to really think long term. 

Lesson learned: Start with index funds. Build a good and healthy portfolio. Set aside a small amount to play with once you've developed a strong index fund DCA habit. Buy and HOLD only and only once you've really decided that company X is where you want to park money. Of course hold until something fundamental changes within the company or the market",Nosemyfart,03-18-24,made mistakes that think every new investor should learn from. will list them being very new investor googling stuff like what good stock to buy now sent me to some very horrible companies. didnt lose too much money always chicken shit did not balls to put too much money into something speculative thankfully. just start with index funds once healthy portfolio set aside play funds. selling some stuff too early. like said before chicken shit so never really put too much money into single stocks. so even if my single picks went to zero would sting would be able to recover. my finest move in retrospect selling nvda pre split about each held to shares. did make profit selling yes did again in retrospect shouldve held since had not put in too much to begin with. always believed in never expected to blow up like this though shouldve held. as newbie youre still learning to really think long term. lesson learned start with index funds. build good healthy portfolio. set aside small amount to play with once youve developed strong index fund dca habit. buy hold only only once youve really decided that x where want to park money. of course hold until something fundamental changes within,0.048,0.609,0.343,0.9976,0.21898332238197327,0.14360844095547995,0.49533473203579587

910,Investing,NVDA,"You should never put a large portion of your portfolio into such a strategy. Best to DCA as much as possible because the next crash could be 10+ years from now, and you'd miss out on those gains.

But if you want to, I would say this:

We won't know the opportunities because we don't know the nature of the crash. You'd want to look for things that are being panic-sold, but likely won't be affected by what caused the crash. At the same time, you'd want to avoid stocks that are related to the crash at hand. For example, you wouldn't want to buy Lehman Brothers in 2008 just because it was cheap, but buying something beat down like Berkshire which had little residential or bank exposure would have been a good choice. 

Let's say AI is found to have little real value for some reason no one expected (computing costs end up being way too high, there's an energy crisis that makes it uneconomical, China invades Taiwan and chips become worth more than moonrock, etc.). Huge crash. Would you want to buy NVDA under those circumstances? Probably not. But let's say the panic selling takes down other stuff like Conagra or similar to less than book value, even though there's no disruption in the food market. It's almost sure to recover, you could bag 50% just based on the fear of the market.

In summary, I believe it is not the right strategy to have a list ready beforehand.

923,wallstreetbets,NVDA,"Without making my answer too long and without going too much into the Greeks. This option can significantly increase in value without NVDA ever getting close to or below 540 so by selling the option, you can lose a lot of value in this option very quickly;

1) the spread here is massive and you are selling at the very bottom range so even a true up in the spread could make you lose a lot of money. Aka you sell at 36 cents 1000 contracts so 36k and then the spread narrows  and now the mid is 45 so that would be 45k, even just the spread narrowing means you have lose 9k (25%) 
2) if there is a simple 3% correction it is now more likely that NVDA will in fact reach 540 than it was before the 3% correct and therefore it is likely this option could be worth more than 0.36 (going against you if you sold the put)
3) a 3% correction increases volatility and therefore potentially the value of the option so by selling the option your position could decreases if volatility increases 
4) although selling naked means you don’t necessarily need the full 54million in cash to cash secure, every move of the stock or other factors of the Greeks that impact your position would cause your profit/loss to move and the broker is within their right to margin call you and sell your position (and any other positions) at a huge loss if they are concerned you do not have the funds to cover based on their individual Terms and conditions you agreed to by signing up to that brokerage

All in all this trade carries significant risk and you could lose a lot of money extremely quickly so please do additional research on the risks associated with selling naked options.

Completely hypothetical scenario but let’s put this into numbers. Assuming NVDA goes X% down and it’s still not close to 540 but it’s lower than the current 875 and volatility has increased due to the downward move in NVDA then the option you sold at 0.36 would likely be higher and let’s just say for the sake of this example the option has moved to 0.96 that’s a circa $60,000 unrealized loss and although you might be willing to hold this to expiry in 2 weeks and you are assuming NVDA won’t go all the way down to 540, your broker may not have the same risk tolerance as you and based on the specific contract you entered into with them, they may request that you send in cash immediately (usually same day) to cover the negative 60,000 on this current unrealized loss or be at risk of the broker closing the position for you and then demanding the cash or that you sell other stock in your portfolio to cover the loss that the broker has just realised for you. That’s one of the risks of selling naked options is that you may not be able to hold until expiry. Selling cash covered puts holds much less risk due to the above margin call risk associated with naked options.

**The Mother of All Speculative Bubbles: Tulip mania**
  

  
Tulip mania occurred during the Dutch Golden Age, when the Dutch Republic became a maritime and economic powerhouse, and the Netherlands had the largest economy in the world. The Dutch East India Company held a monopoly on the spice trade, and established the world’s first stock exchange, boosting Dutch economic growth. When Tulip mania occurred, contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels. The major acceleration began in 1634 and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637.
  

  
Tulip mania is widely considered to be the first recorded speculative bubble or asset bubble in history. During this time, tulip bulbs became a symbol of wealth and status, and their prices soared to incredible heights. At the peak of tulip mania, single tulip bulbs were selling for more than ten times the annual income of a skilled artisan. During the height of tulip mania, a skilled crafts worker typically earned about 300 guilders per year (equivalent to around 1,800 euros today). Imagine paying 18,000 euros for a single flower bulb! The rarest tulip bulbs fetched even higher astronomical sums.
  

  
The term “tulip mania” is now often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble when asset prices deviate dramatically higher from intrinsic values. It serves as a cautionary tale about irrational exuberance in financial markets. Tulip mania gained popular attention in 1841 with the publication of the book **“Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds”** by Scottish journalist Charles Mackay. Mackay claimed that many investors were ruined by the fall in tulip prices. Tulip mania was a fascinating episode in economic history, where the speculative allure of tulips led to both incredible wealth, and eventual disillusionment and financial ruin.

1050,Investing,TSM,"This is just my rationale; I'm 100% open to criticism on it, I'm by no means infallible.

For me, Jensen said it best, generative AI can take any business with a digital aspect and make its production 3-6x faster and thus more efficient. The Bears seem up in arms that NVDA is highly speculated (taking a position with substantial risk of loss or profit), but there's no competitor poised to really step in and replace Nvidia or even compete with them, really. Competition is inevitable, but replacement? No. 

While Nvidia doesn't make their own chips, who does? With 80% market share (and growing based on earnings) and companies wanting to leap ahead of competitors in a global market, no one is waiting to pull the trigger on AI, they already want it they just have difficulty getting their hands on it and supply is getting better. What other company can basically proclaim in their earnings call that every product they make this year will sell out and that their limitation will be supply? Not AMD, nor Intel.

Thinking about Microsoft (3T market cap) and Apple (2.6T market cap), Nvidia (2.2T market cap) is in a position to meet or overtake both of these because their hoppers can help—literally—any company looking to use generative AI and they are mostly software-driven and tuned up by subscription which could be almost every company using it paying for this update-service. Nvidia going to $1,050/share would be about 2.6T market cap and $1200/share would be 3T market cap? I can see Nvidia doing a 10:1 share split and becoming part of a trifecta with Apple and Microsoft, a sort of global tech tripod, so to speak. They have carved out their market niche, they just need to keep it. That will be sured up once the U.S. starts making their own chips, relying less on TSM. I do worry about Taiwan and China getting into it a bit, but that would also screw China over to disrupt their own supply, and inspire of what many people may think. China isn't really the ""start a war"" type. I think China is more interested in maintaining its market footing and competitiveness. War screws that up. So for now I think that part looks okay.

I do worry I'm overly optimistic. That's my issue. Nvidia is over its 50-day moving average and 21-day fast moving average, but I don't think that's necessarily deserving of a drop, bears be damned.  My suspicion is that it will meet resistance around.  $1050 and $1200 to overtake Apple and Microsoft, respectively. As for when it will get there... I think the ""market"" has chosen their footing and are waiting for receipts. Vanguard and Blackrock have 8.2% and 7.2% stakes in Nvidia respectively. I feel like they are in it for a 3-5 year investment.

The goal of many people is simply to get the most overall return from their investments (overall return = dividends + growth).

Although you should be investing in tax-sheltered accounts such as a 401k/457b to make this less relevant.
